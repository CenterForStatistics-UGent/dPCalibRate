2. accuracyPower.R: simulation study for power calculation (Table 3 in manuscript, full version: Table 2 in Supplementary File)
3. caseStudy.R: qualitative and quantitative assessments for the case study data (Figure 6 and text in manuscript)
4. graphsForSupplementary.R: create the plots comparing OLS/WLS/robustWLS in the Supplementary material (Figure 1 in Supplementary File)
5. linearityQualitative.R: create the visual assessment of linearity (Figure 2 and 3 in manuscript)
6. linearitySimulationRSquared.R: simulation study for R^2 statistic (Figure 1 in manuscript)
7. power.R: simulation study to assess type I error rate/power of the four statistical tests (Table 2 in manuscript, full version: Table 1 in Supplementary File)
